## 💡 Project Decisions

I chose to keep things simple and build the project step by step. I started by implementing the search page, followed by the preferred page, and then the home page to display some default recipes. Once the main pages were ready, I added a top navigation bar to make it easy to switch between sections.

For this first version, I decided to store user data in localStorage for simplicity. In the future, as the app grows, it will be straightforward to migrate to a state manager like Zustand or Redux to better support scalability and more advanced features.
